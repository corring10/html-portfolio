<h1>Best Movies According to Sean</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Few Good Men</h3>
<p>
Doesn't matter how many times I have watched it, if I see it on or available
on demand I will watch it.
</p>
<h3>Count of Monte Cristo</h3>
<p>
One of my favorite Jim Cavisal movies. The plot twists, witty lines and the story of love that endures.
A must have to watch.
</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings: Two Towers</h3>
<p>
Great movies series overall. But I have to say the story just hits way differently here in Middle Earth!
